# MongoDB Aggregation $group Stage Error on Large Datasets

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the MongoDB aggregation framework's `$group` stage with large datasets. The issue stems from an inefficient query execution plan that can lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.

## Problem
The provided `bug.js` file contains a sample aggregation pipeline that groups documents by a specific field and counts the occurrences. When executed against a large dataset, this pipeline may return incorrect group counts.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file offers a revised aggregation pipeline designed for better performance and accuracy with large datasets.  This may involve optimizing the query using indexes or modifying the aggregation stages to reduce the processing load.

## Setup
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install MongoDB.
3.  Populate a MongoDB collection with a substantial amount of data.
4.  Run the provided JavaScript files using the MongoDB shell.

## Reproduction
Execute `bug.js`. Observe the output and compare it to the expected results. Note the discrepancies, especially when dealing with large datasets.

## Resolution
Execute `bugSolution.js`. Observe that this revised query provides accurate and more efficient aggregation results on large datasets.  This demonstrates the importance of optimizing queries for performance and accuracy in MongoDB aggregations.
